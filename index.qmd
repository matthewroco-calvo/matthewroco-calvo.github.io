Hi my name is Matthew Roco-Calvo! This is my website for my ENV S 193 DS project, and I am excited to continually update it as I progress through my education and future career.

I am an undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara pursuing a bachelor of science in environmental studies and expecting to graduate in June 2027. Currently I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Bren School of working under Zoe Sims studying the effects of intercropping on crop yields. I also am a Docent/Informal Science Educator at the REEF aquarium at UCSB.
