I am a second year environmental studies major who loves the ocean. I hope to pursue a career in human-environmental health in order to make the places in which we reside healthier, sustainable, and overall more pleasant to live in.

Outside of school and work I enjoy cooking and baking, although most times you will catch me throwing together whatever I can find in my fridge into a quick fried rice. 

## Background

Although I have lived in California for the past 6 years (almost 7 in July), I am originally from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvannia but moved to Dubai before I was one. Here are some pictures of me as a child.

The photo on the left features the still under construction Burj Khalifa in the background, which would become the tallest building in the world. The photo on the right has the Burj al Arab, which is considered the only 7 star hotel in the world (although I have never been inside).

I moved to the United States when I was 13 right before starting 8th grade, and have been here ever since.

## Experience

As an Environmental Studies student, it can be intimidating trying to find a niche that really speaks to me in a field that is so broad and diverse. As such, I have been attempting to explore opportunities in different areas of the Environment.

Starting in January of this year, I have volunteered as a Docent at the Research Experience and Education Facility (REEF) here at UCSB. The REEF is a touch tank aquarium, and is focused on outreach and education. During my shifts I help with animal husbandry tasks such as feeding and cleaning, as well as assisting with outreach programs and educating visitors about the many marine organisms of the Santa Barbara channel.

Research is another aspect of Environmental Studies that I am interested in, and I have the opportunity to work as a research assistant under Zoe Sims. Her project is a meta-analysis of scientific literature on intercropping, or the practice of growing multiple types of crops on the same field, in order to understand how this agriculture system can improve crop yields and nitrogen fertilizer use.
