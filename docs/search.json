As such, I have been attempting to explore opportunities in different areas of the Environment.\nStarting in January of this year, I have volunteered as a Docent at the Research Experience and Education Facility (REEF) here at UCSB. The REEF is a touch tank aquarium, and is focused on outreach and education. During my shifts I help with animal husbandry tasks such as feeding and cleaning, as well as assisting with outreach programs and educating visitors about the many marine organisms of the Santa Barbara channel.\nResearch is another aspect of Environmental Studies that I am interested in, and I have the opportunity to work as a research assistant under Zoe Sims. Her project is a meta-analysis of scientific literature on intercropping, or the practice of growing multiple types of crops on the same field, in order to understand how this agriculture system can improve crop yields and nitrogen fertilizer use."
