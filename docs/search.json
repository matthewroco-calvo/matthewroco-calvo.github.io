This is my website for my ENV S 193 DS project, and I am excited to continually update it as I progress through my education and future career.\nI am an undergraduate student at UC Santa Barbara pursuing a bachelor of science in environmental studies and expecting to graduate in June 2027\nCurrently I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the Bren School of working under Zoe Sims studying the effects of intercropping on crop yields. I also am a Docent/Informal Science Educator at the REEF aquarium at UCSB, where I help with animal husbandry tasks such as feeding and cleaning, as well as assisting with outreach programs and educating visitors about the many marine organisms of the Santa Barbara channel."

In this, I aimed to study how urbanization and restoration impacted soil characteristics in Goleta, specifically comparing the North Campus Open Space restoration area to the Coal Oil Point Reserve soils.\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This browser does not support PDFs.

Below is the code chunk where I created a plot comparing the mean Tussock (a grass) mound height in cm between burned and unburned areas in Alaska.\n\nggplot(data = tussocks_clean, #starting with tussocks_clean data frame\n       aes(\n         x = site, #using site as the X axis\n         y = average_moss_cm, #using average moss height as the y axis\n         color = site #coloring by site (burned or unburned)\n       )) +\n  geom_jitter(  #first layer is a jitterplot, which allows us to see the underlying data\n    height = 0, #ensuring there is no verticle jitter (preserving the values)\n    width = 0.1, #reducing the horizontal jitter\n    shape = 21,  #making the shape open circles\n    alpha = 0.4 #making the circles more transparent\n             ) +\n  geom_pointrange( #adding the mean and standard error\n      data = tussocks_summary, #using the tussocks_summary dataframe\n      aes(x = site, #x axis is site\n          y = mean, #y axis is mean\n          ymax = mean + standard_error, #y max is the mean + the standard error\n          ymin = mean - standard_error #y min is the mean - the standard error\n          )\n      ) +\n \n  labs( x = \"Site\", #labeling the x and y axes using labs\n        y = \"Tussock Mound Height (cm)\",\n        title = \"Tussock Mound Height in Burned and Unburned Areas\",\n        subtitle = \"Matthew Roco-Calvo\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = #changing the colors of each site\n                     c(\"Burned\" = \"tomato3\", #using a dark red to represent burn areas \n                      \"Unburned\" = \"palegreen3\" #using a dark green to represent unburned areas.\n                         ))+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\", #removing the legend\n        panel.grid = element_blank(), #removing gridlines\n        panel.background = element_blank(), #making the background white\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,\n                                  face = \"bold\"), #centering the title and bolding it\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5) #centering the subtitle\n        ) \n\n\nFigure 3b. Tussock Mound Heights are larger in burned areas than unburned areas.\nData from Steketee, Jess K., Adrian V. Rocha, Laura Gough, Kevin L. Griffin, Ian Klupar, Ruby An, Nicole Williamson, and Rebecca J. Rowe. 2022. “ Small Herbivores with Big Impacts: Tundra Voles (Microtus Oeconomus) Alter Post-Fire Ecosystem Dynamics.” Ecology 103(7): e3689.\nOpen circles represent observations of tussock mound height (cm) (total n= 190). Filled circle represents mean. Colors represent site location (red: burned, green = unburned). Bars represent standard error."
