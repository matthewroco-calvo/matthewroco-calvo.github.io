### Tyrosinase Experiment

This was my final project from my MCDB 1LL Lab course, where we conducted an experiment assessing how the pH conditions affect the enzymatic activity of Tyrosinase, which is a protein that is responsible for the production of melanin and animals, as well as fruits and vegetables.

### Soils Project

Below was my final project for my ENV S 114 class, which was Introduction of Soil Science. In this, I aimed to study how urbanization and restoration impacted soil characteristics in Goleta, specifically comparing the North Campus Open Space restoration area to the Coal Oil Point Reserve soils.

### Code Chunk Example

For my midterm for my Environmental Data Science course, I had to create a figure in RStudio using a dataset from a paper. Below is the code chunk where I created a plot comparing the mean Tussock (a grass) mound height in cm between burned and unburned areas in Alaska.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = tussocks_clean, #starting with tussocks_clean data frame
       aes(
         x = site, #using site as the X axis
         y = average_moss_cm, #using average moss height as the y axis
         color = site #coloring by site (burned or unburned)
       )) +
  geom_jitter(  #first layer is a jitterplot, which allows us to see the underlying data
    height = 0, #ensuring there is no verticle jitter (preserving the values)
    width = 0.1, #reducing the horizontal jitter
    shape = 21,  #making the shape open circles
    alpha = 0.4 #making the circles more transparent
             ) +
  geom_pointrange( #adding the mean and standard error
      data = tussocks_summary, #using the tussocks_summary dataframe
      aes(x = site, #x axis is site
          y = mean, #y axis is mean
          ymax = mean + standard_error, #y max is the mean + the standard error
          ymin = mean - standard_error #y min is the mean - the standard error
          )
      ) +
 
  labs( x = "Site", #labeling the x and y axes using labs
        y = "Tussock Mound Height (cm)",
        title = "Tussock Mound Height in Burned and Unburned Areas",
        subtitle = "Matthew Roco-Calvo") +
  scale_color_manual(values = #changing the colors of each site
                     c("Burned" = "tomato3", #using a dark red to represent burn areas 
                      "Unburned" = "palegreen3" #using a dark green to represent unburned areas.
                         ))+ 
  theme(legend.position = "none", #removing the legend
        panel.grid = element_blank(), #removing gridlines
        panel.background = element_blank(), #making the background white
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,
                                  face = "bold"), #centering the title and bolding it
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5) #centering the subtitle
        ) 
```

**Figure 3b. Tussock Mound Heights are larger in burned areas than unburned areas.**

Data from Steketee, Jess K., Adrian V. Rocha, Laura Gough, Kevin L. Griffin, Ian Klupar, Ruby An, Nicole Williamson, and Rebecca J. Rowe. 2022. “ Small Herbivores with Big Impacts: Tundra Voles (Microtus Oeconomus) Alter Post-Fire Ecosystem Dynamics.” Ecology 103(7): e3689.

Open circles represent observations of tussock mound height (cm) (total n= 190). Filled circle represents mean. Colors represent site location (red: burned, green = unburned). Bars represent standard error.
