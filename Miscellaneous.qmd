## Music

I love music, and I really enjoy singing. Unfortunately I am too scared to include videos of that, although I did actually consider it! I have decided to substitute it with some playlists I have made, I hope whoever is viewing this is not too dissapointed by this repacement. Anyway, here is a playlist I made for cloudier days, such as the one's we have been having here in Santa Barbara recently.

As much as I want everyone to believe that my curated playlists represent me, I realize that my "On Repeat" playlist generated by Spotify is a little bit more honest with my actual listening habits, so I will be vulnerable and share that here as well.
